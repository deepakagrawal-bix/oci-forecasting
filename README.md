# Welcome to Time Series Forecasting Service!

A Time Series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Time Series Forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values. Forecasting could be applied in fields like financial or sales analysis, forecasting weather and workload projections.

OCI Time Series forecasting service is being implemented as a serverless, multi-tenant service, accessible over REST APIs.
